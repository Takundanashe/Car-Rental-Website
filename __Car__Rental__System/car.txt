aston martin dbx 707 2022|twin-turbo 4.0-liter V-8 |542Hp
HIGHS
Gorgeous inside and out, terrific ride and handling traits, more practical than Aston sports cars.
LOWS
Regular model gets outrun by rivals, brake pedal feels too soft, lacks some common driver assists.
VERDICT
The DBX SUV is Aston Martin's design and driving ethos in a more practical and rugged format.




bmw X5 | twin-turbo V-8 523Hp|2020 BMW X6 xDrive40i
HIGHS
Broad range of powerful powertrains, deluxe interior finishes, intuitive infotainment software.
LOWS
The optional third row is cramped, mega turbo V-8 is a pricey option, more luxe than sporty.
VERDICT
The X5 offers impressive performance and a wiff of driving fun to go along with its luxury look and premium feel.

HIGHS
Zesty powertrains, terrific driving traits for an SUV, rated to tow up to 7700 pounds.
LOWS
Ride can be overly firm, countless options can get costly, short on small-item storage.
VERDICT
The Cayenne caters to anyone who wants a luxurious SUV that's also a kick to drive.
460Hp twin-turbo V8



Genesis GV80|3.5L V-6|375Hp
HIGHS
Designer-chic luxury ambiance, well-integrated tech, refined road manners.

LOWS
Snug passenger space in optional third row, twin-turbo V-6 adds a lot of coin to the bottom line, no hybrid or plug-in hybrid option.

VERDICT
When passers-by ask if the GV80 SUV is a Bentley, you know you’re driving something special.

5-passenger, 4-door hatchback

turbocharged and intercooled DOHC 24-valve inline-6, aluminum block and head, direct fuel injection

HIGHS
Road manners, posh interior, impressive standard equipment.

LOWS
X6 is more affordable and practical, M50i requires a major price leap, labyrinthine infotainment menus.

VERDICT
Although the X6 is a taste of fashion over function, its smooth power and smart interior ease the burden of beauty.

TRANSMISSION
8-speed automatic

HIGHS
Blindingly quick yet quiet and smooth, Lamborghini performance for a lot less.

LOWS
Exhaust note could be more exciting, the RS6 Avant wagon also exists.

VERDICT
The RS Q8 is exactly as fast, luxurious, and ridiculous as you’d expect a 591-horsepower SUV with a six-figure price tag to be.



 7-passenger, 4-door wagon 2023 Volvo XC90
he 455-hp T8 plug-in-hybrid XC90 : 8-speed automatic/direct-drive
HIGHS
Super-Swede styling, masterpiece of an interior, XC90 Recharge is a quick accelerator.

LOWS
No-adult third row, expensive second-row captain’s-chair option, at these prices pure EV SUVs start to look competitive.

VERDICT
While every Volvo XC90 delivers on the luxurious end of the business, only its plug-in powertrain will wow SUV shoppers who have a need for speed.

Mercedes-Benz Maybach GLS 600 4MATIC is the top model in the Mercedes-Benz Maybach GLS
 lineup and the price of Maybach GLS top model is ₹ 2.80 Crore.It returns a certified mileage of 8.5 kmpl.
 This 600 4MATIC variant comes with an engine putting out 550 bhp @ 6000 rpm and 730 Nm @ 2500 rpm of max power and 
max torque respectively. Mercedes-Benz Maybach GLS 600 4MATIC is available in Automatic (TC) transmission and offered in 8 colours: Brilliant Blue, Obsidian Black,
 Cavansite Blue, Selenite Silver, Emerald Green, Mojave Silver, Iridium Silver and Polar White (Non Metallic).

he Mercedes-Maybach GLS 600 doesn’t just do opulence in spades, it can also outpace most sports cars with its AMG GT-derived 4-litre twin-turbo V8. That and the fancy features are all wrapped in a striking albeit a little too ostentatious design which I have learnt over time is an acquired taste.

What's obvious here is that the new Range Rover carries on the legacy of its predecessors owing to clever engineering and a rather splendid design. A great achievement indeed.
